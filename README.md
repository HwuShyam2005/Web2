<br>
In this website i have involved working buttons and tables in several areas.
<br>
<br>
Also a navigation bar for redirecting within the webpage has been added with the following sections:
<br>
-> Home
<br>
-> Features
<br>
-> Gallery
<br>
-> Specifications
<br>
-> Contact
<br>
-> Colours
<br>
<br>
I have also added a few screen shots of how the website looks:
<br>
<br>
-> This screen shot of the webpage shows the home page including the working navigation bar with each sections.

<br>
-> The engine specs and other related specs of the car has been shown.

One major thing I have added in this website is the contact us part with working buttons and detects if we have forgotten to fill out any text.
